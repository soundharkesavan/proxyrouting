Proxy routing using python

# Proxy Validation and Website Testing Script

This Python script performs two main tasks: 

1. Validates a list of proxy servers to determine which ones are valid and working.
2. Uses the valid proxy servers to make HTTP requests to specific websites and check their response.
   
Usage
Place your list of proxy servers in a text file named data.txt. Each proxy should be on a separate line.
Example data.txt:

The script will perform the following tasks:

Validate each proxy in the list and print the valid ones.
Use the valid proxies to make HTTP requests to specific websites and print the results.
Configuration
You can customize the list of websites to test by modifying the sites_to_check list in the script.

You can adjust the timeout for HTTP requests by modifying the timeout parameter in the requests.get() function calls.

The number of threads used for proxy validation can be adjusted by changing the value in the range() function when creating threads.
